WARNING:
Widgets here were written without any intention of being compatible with any
configuration/system.

I just wrote them for my own use but thought it might inspire some people and
this is the reason for sharing. So, you may need to adapt some lines of the
code for some widgets to work on your configuration but as they are very simply
written, this should not be difficult at all.
